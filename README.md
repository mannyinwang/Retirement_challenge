# Retirement Challenge

## Project Overview

The aim of the project to extract the number of retiring employees and identify the employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

The results are to be exported to a csv which are listed below:

* Retirement Titles - which highlights the the employee number, full name , title and the start and end date of their employment
* Unique Titles - which does away with the duplicate entries in the Retirement Titles csv file due to employees switching over the years to a different department
* Retiring Titles - which gets the count of the specific titles retiring
* Mentorship Eligibility - shows the employees that are eligible for a mentorship program
